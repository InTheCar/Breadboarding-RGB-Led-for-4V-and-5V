# Breadboarding-RGB-LED-for-4V-and-5V

## The target

The target is to get a module for bread breadboarding to use a RGB LED for 4,2 and 5V.
Why 4,2V and not 4V? 4,2V is the end-of-charge voltage of a li ion a battery pack.

## The Hardware

The RGB is a [LL-509RGBC2E-006](https://github.com/InTheCar/Breadboarding-RGB-Led-for-4V-and-5V/blob/main/Data%20Sheets/LL-509RGBC2E-006.pdf). The used resistors are 0,6W resistors.
- 1x RGB LED LL-509RGBC2E-006
- 1x PBA
